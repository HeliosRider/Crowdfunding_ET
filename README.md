# Task:
Create a repository to Extract, Transform, and Load into a database, the crowdfunding.xlsx and contacts.xlsx data

# Repository name: 
Crowdfunding_ETL

# Background:
The team members were directed to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, 
and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform 
the data. The goal was to transform the data, create four CSV files, and 
upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
Finally, using the CSV files to create a corresponding ERD and table schema. 

# File location
The provided excel and created CSV files are located in the Resources folder of the repository
the Crowdfunding database is located within the repository

# Data Engineering: 
Python (Numpy and Regex)
pandas
SQL 
Excel database

# Data Analysis 
Created the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
Created the Campaign DataFrame
Created the Contacts DataFrame
Created the Crowdfunding Database

# Learning Outcome
The team met some challanges in creating code to support the analysis. However, the team was able to overcome these challeges through trial and error. 
The final coding met the provided query outcomes. So, we deemed the project a success.
